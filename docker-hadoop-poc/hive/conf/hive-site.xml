            Enforce metastore schema version consistency.
            True: Verify that version information stored in is compatible with
            one from Hive jars. Also disable automatic
            schema migration attempt. Users are required to manually migrate
            schema after Hive upgrade which ensures
            proper metastore schema migration. (Default)
            False: Warn if the version information stored in metastore doesn't
            match with one from in Hive jars.
